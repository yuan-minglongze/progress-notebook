# Booleans and Numbers

JavaScript uses one unified `Number` to account for numbers.
`Number` type includes various kinds of numeric values, ranging from simple integers and floating-point numbers to special cases like `Infinity` and `NaN`.

```javascript
const result = 10 / 0; 
console.log(result); // Infinity
const notANumber = 'hello world' / 2;
console.log(notANumber); // NaN
const notANumber = 'hello world' / 2;
console.log(typeof notANumber); // number
```

## arithmetic operators

`+`, minus `-`, asterisk `*`, slash `/`, remainder operator `%`, exponentiation operator `**`

type coercion.

operator precedence determines the order in which operations are evaluated in an expresssion.

increment operator `++`, decrement operator `--`.

compound assignment operators : addition assignment operator `+=`, substraction assignment opperator `-=`, multiplication assignment operator`*=`, division assignment operator `/=`, exponent assignment operator`**=`, remainder assgnment operator`%=`, bitwise AND assignment operator`&=`, bitwise OR assignment operator`|=`.

strict equality operator: `===`, strict inequality operator `!==`.
comparison operators: greater than operator `>`, greater than or equal operator `>=`, lesser than `<`, lesser than or equal operator `<=`.

## unary operators:

- unary plus operator `+`: converts its operand into a number.
- unary negation operator `-`: negates the value of the operand.
- logical NOT operator `!`;
- `void` evaluates an expersion and returns `undefined`. Commonly used in hyperlinks to prevent navigation.
- `typeof`

bitwise operators:

AND `&`, OR `|`, XOR `^`, NOT `~`, left shift `<<`, right shift `>>`.

conditional statements: `if/else`.

falsy values:

- boolean `false`
- `0`
- `""`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`

ternary operator: `condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;`

## binary logical operators:

- logical AND operator is represented by a double ampersand `&&`.
  - if both operands are truthy, it returns the second value.
  - if either operand is falsy, it ruturns the falsy value:
  - if both operand are falsy, it returns the first falsy value.
- logical OR operator `||`
  - If the first operand is truthy, it returns that value.
  - If the first operand is falsy, it returns the second operand.
- nullish coalescing operator. Represented by a double question mark `??`. return a value only if the first one is `null` or `undefined`.

```javascript
const userSettings = {
 theme: null,
 volume: 0,
 notifications: false,
};

let theme = userSettings.theme ?? 'light';
console.log(theme); // light
```

## Math object

`Math.random()` method generates a random floating-point between `[0,1)`.

`Math.max(1,3,5,7), Math.min(1,3,5,7)` take a set of numbers.

`Math.ceil() Math.floor()` rounds numbers up or down to the nearset whole integer. `Math.round()` rounds a number to its nearset integer.

Generate a random number between two whole numbers.

```javascript
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
```

`Math.trunc()` method removes the decimal part of a number, returning only the integer portion, without rounding.

square root `Math.sqrt()`, cube root `Math.curt()`. `Math.pow()`, takes two numbers and raise the first to the power of the second.

absolute value `Math.abs()`.
